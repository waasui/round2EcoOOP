# Round-2-Eco ðŸŒ±
The Round-2-Eco is a simple desktop application which helps people to track/monitor their eco-friendly actions 
such as recycling, saving electricity or even riding a bike. Each of these eco-friendly activities has a 
score/rating and it lets the users know how much impact they are contributing as an individual or maybe 
as a group. It uses Python as its coding language and other tools to keep it simple and easy to use.
